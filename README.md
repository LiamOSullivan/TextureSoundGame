# TextureSoundGame
HTML project for an in-browser subjective test series. 
Users hear a sound and are presented with a choice of image; 
one of the images has been used to generate the audio and 
the subject tries to identify which it is.

The project attempts to collect statistical data on the ability
to identify sound content from a graphical representation using 
novel visualisation techniques.
